= What does this application do?
This is a Java implementation for Tree Traversal Algorithms like BFS, DFS & UCS as a learning exercise.

== What is the problem statement?
The *8 puzzle* consists of eight numbered, movable tiles set in a _3x3 frame_.
One cell of the frame is always empty thus making it possible to move an adjacent numbered tile into the empty cell.
Start with a random state (cannot be fixed). The goal state is listed below.

1 2 3 +
8 0 4 +
7 6 5

The program is to change the initial configuration into the goal configuration.
A solution to the problem is an appropriate sequence of moves.
Implement Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and Uniform-Cost Search (UCS) to solve this problem.
